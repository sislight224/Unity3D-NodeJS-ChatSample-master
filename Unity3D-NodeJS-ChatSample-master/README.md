# Unity3D-NodeJS-ChatSample
A simple chat application using Unity3D as the Client and NodeJS as the Server

This uses Sockets which only work for the stand alone builds. For the webplayer, Unity3D needs to use Websockets which this demonstration does not have.

This demonstration was based on another chat sample between C# and Node.js (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brunoterkaly/archive/2012/02/28/node-js-a-chat-server-written-in-node-and-a-client-app-written-in-c.aspx). I modified it for Unity3D C#.
